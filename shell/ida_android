# Currently in IDA Pro 6.6.140605 there is an issue where the
# Dalvik debugger (JDWP) will assign the local port to the android_server
# default (2346) - meaning if you attempt to do the normal forward of the
# remote port 2346 to the local port, it will collide and one will die.
# There is no actual input for changing the forward on the JDWP port currently
# so I suggest changing your default android_server remote port here.
